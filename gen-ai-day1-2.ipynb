Model Architecture:**\n\n*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a **sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.** This means it builds upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but incorporates a MoE structure.\n*   MoE models use a **learned routing function** to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to have a large total parameter count while only activating a portion of those parameters for any given input.\n\n**2. Training Data:**\n\n*   The model is trained on a **variety of multimodal and multilingual data.**\n*   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from many different domains, including **web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.**\n\n**3. Training Infrastructure:**\n\n*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is trained on **multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators**, distributed across multiple datacenters.\n\n**4. Training Process:**\n\n*   **Pre-training:** The model is initially pre-trained on the large, diverse dataset mentioned above.\n*   **Instruction Tuning:** After pre-training, Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n*   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning is performed based on human preference data.\n\n**Key Aspects and Innovations:**\n\n*   **Long Context Understanding:** A series of significant architecture changes enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n*   **Efficiency:** Improvements across the entire model stack (architecture, data, optimization, and systems) allow Gemini 1.5 Pro to achieve comparable quality to Gemini 1.0 Ultra while using significantly less training compute and being significantly more efficient to serve.\n*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal and supports interleaving of data from different modalities (audio, visual, text, code) in the same input sequence.\n\nIn summary, the training process involves a combination of large-scale pre-training on diverse multimodal data, followed by instruction tuning and human preference tuning, all leveraging a MoE architecture and Google's TPU infrastructure. A key focus is on enabling the model to handle extremely long contexts effectively.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import enum\n\n# Define the evaluation prompt\nSUMMARY_PROMPT = \"\"\"\\\n# Instruction\nYou are an expert evaluator.

For example, you show it pictures of cats and say \"cat,\" pictures of dogs and say \"dog,\" and so on. You also read it lots of stories and talk to it all the time. The puppy is like the computer model, and all the pictures, stories, and conversations are the training data.\n\n2.  **Learning the Patterns:** The puppy starts to notice patterns. It sees that cats have pointy ears and whiskers, and dogs have floppy ears and wagging tails. It also learns that certain words go together, like \"good\" and \"boy.\" The computer model does the same thing. It looks for patterns in the training data and learns how words, images, and sounds are related.\n\n3.  **Making Predictions:** Now, you show the puppy a new picture, and you ask, \"What's this?\" The puppy tries to guess based on what it has learned. If it says \"cat\" when it sees a cat, that's good! If it says \"dog,\" you gently correct it. The computer model also makes predictions. It might try to guess the next word in a sentence or answer a question about a picture.\n\n4.  **Getting Better and Better:** Every time the puppy makes a mistake, you help it learn from that mistake. You give it feedback so it can do better next time. The computer model also gets feedback. It adjusts its internal settings to make better predictions in the future. This process is repeated over and over again, with more and more examples, until the puppy (or the computer model) becomes very good at understanding and following instructions.\n\nSo, in short, training a large language model is like teaching a puppy: you show it lots of examples, it learns the patterns, it makes predictions, and it gets better and better with feedback.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by two AI models. We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B). You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n\nYou will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.\n\n# Evaluation\n## Metric Definition\nYou will be assessing question answering quality, which measures the overall quality of the answer to the question in the user prompt. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a question-answering task is provided in the user prompt. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).\n## Criteria\nInstruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the question answering task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.\nGroundedness: The response contains information included only in the context if the context is present in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.\nCompleteness: The response completely answers the question with sufficient detail.\nFluent: The response is well-organized and easy to read.\n\n## Rating Rubric\n\"A\": Response A answers the given question as per the criteria better than response B.\n\"SAME\": Response A and B answers the given question equally well as per the criteria.\n\"B\": Response B answers the given question as per the criteria better than response A.\n\n## Evaluation Steps\nSTEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response A fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\nSTEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response B fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\nSTEP 3: Compare the overall performance of Response A and Response B based on your analyses and assessment.\nSTEP 4: Output your preference of \"A\", \"SAME\" or \"B\" to the pairwise_choice field according to the Rating Rubric.\nSTEP 5: Output your assessment reasoning in the explanation field.\n\n# User Inputs and AI-generated Responses\n## User Inputs\n### Prompt\n{prompt}\n\n# AI-generated Response\n\n### Response A\n{baseline_model_response}\n\n### Response B\n{response}\n\"\"\"\n\n\nclass AnswerComparison(enum.Enum):\n  A = 'A'\n  SAME = 'SAME'\n  B = 'B'\n@functools.cache\ndef eval_pairwise(prompt, response_a, response_b, n=1):\n  \"\"\"Determine the better of two answers to the same prompt.\"\"\"\n\n  chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash')\n\n  # Generate the full text response.\n  response = chat.send_message(\n      message=QA_PAIRWISE_PROMPT.format(\n          prompt=[prompt, document_file],\n          baseline_model_response=response_a,\n          response=response_b)\n  )\n  verbose_eval = response.text\n\n  # Coerce into the desired structure.\n  structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n      response_mime_type=\"text/x.enum\",\n      response_schema=AnswerComparison,\n  )\n  response = chat.send_message(\n      message=\"Convert the final score.\",\n      config=structured_output_config,\n  )\n  structured_eval = response.parsed\n\n  return verbose_eval, structured_eval\n\n\nquestion = questions[0]\nanswer_a = answer_question(question, terse_guidance)\nanswer_b = answer_question(question, cited_guidance)\n\ntext_eval, struct_eval = eval_pairwise(\n    prompt=question,\n    response_a=answer_a,\n    response_b=answer_b,\n)\n\ndisplay(Markdown(text_eval))\nprint(struct_eval)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-03T14:05:42.109705Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-03T14:05:42.110100Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-03T14:05:43.779092Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-03T14:05:42.110074Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-03T14:05:43.777956Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"## Individual Response Analysis\nResponse A: Response A is a concise answer to the prompt question.\nResponse B: Response B is a comprehensive answer to the prompt question.
