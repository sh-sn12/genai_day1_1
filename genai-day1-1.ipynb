Sure, he enjoyed sunbeams and the occasional feathered toy, but a restless spirit simmered beneath his striped fur. He yearned for more than the predictable rhythm of naps and kibble. He dreamt of the Whispering Woods, a place his grandmother, a notorious wanderer, had described with wide, emerald eyes.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, Jasper decided. He slipped out the slightly ajar back door, a sliver of freedom beckoning him. The familiar scent of Mrs. Higgins' rose bushes faded as he ventured beyond the manicured lawn, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves growing stronger. He was on his way to the Whispering Woods.\n\nThe journey was fraught with peril. A grumpy bulldog named Brutus, with a bark that could curdle milk, chased him up a towering oak. He navigated a treacherous stream, leaping from mossy stone to mossy stone, his tail twitching with concentration. He even outsmarted a flock of gossiping crows, distracting them with a shiny bottle cap while he scurried past.\n\nFinally, he arrived. The Whispering Woods lived up to its name. The wind rustled through the ancient trees, creating a symphony of whispers that seemed to speak secrets to the earth. Sunlight dappled through the canopy, painting the forest floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow.\n\nJasper explored, his senses on high alert. He discovered a hidden glade where mushrooms glowed with an ethereal light. He befriended a wise old owl named Professor Hoot, who shared stories of the forest's history. He even helped a family of squirrels retrieve their stolen acorns from a mischievous blue jay.\n\nBut the most remarkable thing Jasper found was a small, sparkling stream. As he lapped at the cool water, he noticed something glinting beneath the surface. He reached in a paw and pulled out a smooth, grey stone, etched with swirling patterns. As he held it, a wave of warmth washed over him, and he understood. This was the Stone of Whispers, a legendary artifact said to amplify the forest's voice.\n\nHolding the stone, Jasper felt a deep connection to the woods. He understood the language of the rustling leaves, the chattering squirrels, the hooting owl. He felt a responsibility to protect this magical place.\n\nAfter a week of adventure, a pang of longing for his warm bed and familiar scratching post tugged at him. He knew he couldn't stay forever. He said goodbye to Professor Hoot, promising to visit again soon.\n\nAs he walked back towards home, the Stone of Whispers tucked safely in his fur, Jasper was no longer just an ordinary tabby. He was Jasper, the adventurer, the friend of the forest, the guardian of the Whispering Woods. He knew his life would never be the same. He had tasted adventure, and the taste was intoxicating. He was home, but a part of him would always remain in the Whispering Woods, listening to the secrets whispered on the wind. And he knew, with absolute certainty, that this was just the beginning of his adventures.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    temperature=0.1,\n    top_p=1,\n    max_output_tokens=5,\n)\n\nzero_shot_prompt = \"\"\"Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\nReview: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction\nhumanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,\nunchecked.

Most of the authors on this paper were affiliated with Google Brain at the time, indicating they were likely past their PhD stage.\n\n* **Aidan N. Gomez:**  Looking at their career paths *after* the paper, Aidan N. Gomez stands out as someone who co-founded a company (Cohere) relatively quickly after.

This is speculative, but it's a possible indicator.\n\n**Why it's hard to be certain:**\n\n* **Varied Backgrounds:**  Even within Google Brain, authors could have joined from various backgrounds and at different stages of their careers.  Some might have had industry experience before academia, or vice versa.\n* **Age is Not Always Linear with Career Stage:**  Someone could have taken breaks in their education or career for various reasons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout access to the authors' birthdates, it's impossible to definitively say who was the youngest.\n\n**However, if we were to make an *educated guess* based on career trajectory and publicly available information, Aidan N. Gomez might be a *potential* candidate for being among the younger authors on the paper.**\n\n**To be absolutely certain, you would need to find personal biographical information for each author, which is likely not publicly available or easily accessible.**\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is: **It is not possible to definitively determine the youngest author without access to their birthdates.

In short, it aims to make your prompt more informative when you're working in a Git repository.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Git Prompt Enhancement:**  The core function of this script is to display useful information about the Git repository you're currently in directly in your command prompt.  This might include the current branch, the status of the working directory (modified, staged, untracked files), and information about remote branches.\n\n*   **Customization:** It's highly customizable. You can change the colors, symbols, and what information is displayed.  It uses \"themes\" to control the look and feel.\n\n*   **Bash/Zsh Compatibility:** The script tries to work with both Bash and Zsh shells, addressing some of the compatibility issues between them.\n\n*   **Asynchronous Updates:**  It can optionally fetch remote branch status in the background, so your prompt doesn't lag while waiting for Git to check the remote repository.\n\n*   **Prompt Command Integration:** The script modifies the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable to automatically update the prompt with Git information every time a command finishes.\n\n**Why use it?**\n\nIf you work with Git a lot, this script can significantly improve your workflow by providing instant visual feedback on the state of your repositories.  You can immediately see if you have uncommitted changes, which branch you're on, and whether your local branch is ahead or behind the remote. This eliminates the need to constantly run `git status` and other Git commands, saving you time and effort.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":48}]}
